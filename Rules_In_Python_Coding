In addition to process, creativity, and quality you'll also learn what I consider five important topics a modern programmer needs to function.
These may change in the future, but they've been essential for decades now, so unless there's a drastic shift in technology they'll still apply.
Even something like SQL in Part VI is still relevant because it teaches you how to structure data so that it doesn't logically fall apart later.
Your secondary educational goals are:

Getting Started -- You learn this by doing Quick Hacks to learn how to start a project.

Data Structures -- I don't teach every single data structure, but I get you started down the path to learning them more completely.

Algorithms -- Data Structures are fairly pointless without a way to process them.

Parsing Text -- The foundation of computer science is parsing, and knowing how to do that helps you learn programming languages as they become popular.

Data Modeling -- I will use SQL to teach you the basics of modeling stored data in a logical way.

Unix Tools -- Command line tools are used throughout the book as projects for you to copy, and you then also learn advanced Unix command line tools.
