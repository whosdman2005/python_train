# Homework
# Now write a similar game to Exer25theHardWay.py It can be any kind of game you want in the same flavour.
# Spend a week on it, making it as interesting as possible. For Study Drills, use lists, functions, modules
# as much as possible, and find as many new pieces of Python as you can to make the game work.
# However, before you start coding, you must WRITE UP a MAP for your game. Create the rooms, monsters, and traps
# that the player must go through on paper before you CODE.

# Once you have your MAP, try to code it up. If you find problems with the map, then ADJUST IT and make the code MATCH.

# One final word of advice: ALL PROGRAMMERS BECOME PARALYZED BY IRRATIONAL FEAR STARTING A NEW LARGE PROJECT.
# They procrastinate to AVOID CONFRONTING THIS FEAR and end up not getting their program working or even started.
# I DO THIS. EVERYONE DOES. The best way to AVOID THIS is to MAKE A LIST of things you should do and then DO THEM ONE AT A TIME!!!

# JUST START DOING IT, DO A SMALL VERSION, MAKE IT BIGGER, KEEP A LIST OF THINGS TO DO, AND DO THEM!!!
