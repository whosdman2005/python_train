# You should be reading any Python code you can and trying to steal ideas that you find.
You actually should have enough knowledge to be able to read by maybe not understand what the code does.
What i'm going to teach you in this lesson is how to apply things you have learned to understand other
people's code.

a. Functions and what they do
b. Where each variable is first given a value
c. Any variables with the same names in different parts of the program. These may be troubles later.
d. Any if-statements without else clauses. Are they right?
e. Any while-loops that might not end
f. Finally, any parts of code that you can't understand for whatever reason

Once you have all this marked up, try to explain it to yourself by writing comments as you go.
Explain the functions, how they are used, what variables are involved, and anything you can to figure this code out.

Lastly, on all the difficult parts, trace the values of each variable line by line, function by function.
In fact, do another printout and write in the margin the value of each variable that you need to "trace"

Once you have a good idea of what the code does, go back to the computer and read it again to see if you find new things.
Keep finding more code and doing this until you do not need the printouts anymore.
