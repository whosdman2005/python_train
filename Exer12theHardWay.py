# issue a pydoc command in order to refresh on how to use a module
# pydoc is a utility that is installed when you install Python. It allows you to quickly retrieve and search for documentation from your shell
# e.g: (in windows)
# From your IDE terminal type: python -m pydoc <module>
# python -m pydoc time
# python -m pydoc sys
# python -m pydoc open
# python -m pydoc file
# python -m pydoc os
# a good reference is https://docs.python-guide.org/
